Reflection: biggest takeaway is "we chisel away the imperfections when we review it with our peers. Don't beat yourself up for first drafts that need improvement. Beat up the code instead!”.    How come we didn’t learn this on the front-end???? Geeeeez that would have helped knowing there is light at the end of the tunnel.  At least now I know I’m not alone in the what the what moments the author described. 

3 takeaways : 1.code should be readable and searchable,  2. the code should give understanding why you need to remove dead code and 3. do not over optimize. Just make the code simple and readable.
